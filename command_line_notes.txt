# why learn the command line 
1. more control over my machine ... there are many things that can only do from the command line (that can't do from the GUI, ie graphically)
2. it's faster than using the GUI 
3. universality, ie will run on any machine (ie will work the same on linux and mac)
4. its a requirement to being a software engineer
5. necessary for cloud computing

# a shell is software that is a computer inferface to an OS. shells expose the OS's services to human users or other programs. the shell takes our commands and gives them to the OS to perform
