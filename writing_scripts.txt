note that he discusses bash scripting (am assuming for me will be mostly the same as zsh is built on top of the bash shell)

basic steps 
  1. write a script in a file and save it
  2. make the script executable using chmod
  3. verify that the shell can find your script 

// shebang
the first line of our script should read #!/bin/bash (for bash shell scripts)
the #! is called the shebang, and its used to tell the OS which interpreter it should use when parsing this file 

after the shebang, we need to include the path to the Bash binary. this is not Bash specific... for ex, if we wanted to write a python script, we would include the path to the python binary 

// PATH variable 

the path variable is a list of directories that the shell will look inside of for executable programs, separated by colons (:) 
when we execute a command, shell will look inside PATH starting with the first directory and continuing in order until find the command 

-note that I made a command 'hi', put it in ~/bin and added ~/bin to the PATH
