man 
//==> manual pages are built-in docs that explain how to use various commands 
ex 
> man ex_command  
type q to get out of the manual
scroll up/down w arrow keys
f or spacebar will go down one page, b will go back one page
/-option allows us to search within man pages
note that some commands have no man page, in which case they will have a help page and can use..
> help ex_command 
--
control-d will quit out of a running program
--
type
#==> tells us the type of a command, ie where or how it is defined, there are four types 
--
which
#==> tells us where the command is located (ex in what directory is located)
--

// NAVIGATING YOUR MACHINE //

pwd 
#==> print working directory command asks "where am i?" and will print the path of your current working directory starting from the root / 
--
ls
#==> the list command will list the contents of a directory.
with no options or arguments, it prints a list of the files and filters located in the current directory
ls path (ex. ls /Users/gcochran/Desktop OR ls Desktop) will list the contents of a specific directory
// useful ls options

ls -l #==> will give us the "long" format for the directory (ex. permissions, size, modification date, etc)

ls -a #==> will show us all files and folders including hidden files/folders (note that hidden files/folders start with a dot (ex. .cache))
--

// CREATING FILES/FOLDERS //

touch 
#==> provide a filename and that file will be created in the current directory 
- can create multiple files at once (ex. > touch ex1.txt ex2.txt)
- dont need to create the file in the current directory, just provide the path before the file name
--
- the file extension (ex. .txt would be the extension) in the name of the file is not what determines the file type.... (but need to have the correct file type in the name so that various applications know how to treat the file, ex. open a .pdf in a pdf viewer app)
- can use the filt command to determine file type (ex. .txt .pdf .jpg etc)

#
rules for naming files & folders

- stick to numbers, letters, underscores and dashes (use camelCase if one idea rather than having spaces); DONT USE ANY OTHER SYMBOLS 
- AVOID SPACES in names [have to use "" in order to use any commands in terminal for files/folders that are multiple words; or can escape the space with \; ex. file Launch\ School ]
#

mkdir 
#==> creates new folders (aka directories)
- like touch, can make multiple at once & create one outside the current directory by giving the path
mkdir -p #==> will make nested folders, ex...
  mkdir -p Horses/Mares (will create a horses folder and a mares folder inside of it)

# DELETING, COPYING & MOVING #

rm 
#==> deletes files from our machine
- note that cannot undo (unlike if we were to move a file to trash with GUI), does delete permanently 
rm file.txt #==> will delete file.txt if that file exists in the current directory 

- can delete multiple things at once, like many other commands previously discussed 
- like many other commands, can write the relative or absolute path to remove a file from another directory that are not currently in

rm -d FOLDER #==> will delete directories, if they are empty 
note that rmdir works the exact same as rm -d 
.. for both, only work on empty directories 

rm -r FOLDER #==> will delete the directory, recursively ie will delete all child folders/files of that directory therefore be careful with this command

can use rm -ri rather than rm -r #==> which protects against mistakes because will prompt user before deleting the folder 

--

mv 
#==> the move command moves files and directories from one location to another 
> mv source destination 
- note that have to provide paths... ofc 
- can move multiple files/folders at once 
- note that the destination folder has to exist, otherwise will rename or not work 
- if only want to move a file into the parent folder of current folder.. just do > mv file .. 

// to rename // 

> mv source newName 
- can only rename one thing at a time 
- can both rename and move to a new location at the same time .. just add path 
ex. > mv file.txt ~/Desktop/file2.txt [this renamed the file and moved it to my Desktop directory]

-- 

cp 
#==> copy command to create copies of files and folders
> cp file copyOfFile 
- can also move as am copying within the same command, just provide a destination path ex. ~/copyOfFile 
- to copy directories, need to copy all the contents of that folder, ie need to copy it recursively
> cp -r file copyOfFile 

-- 
history 
#==> will print all previous commands that have run 
history | less #==> view all commands in more manageable way, exit with q 

// history expansion 
> !linenumberofthecommandthatwantorerun

- can search through all previous commands in the history with ctrl-r and then type keywords [escape this search bar with down arrow]

-- 

cat 
#==> concatenates (ie joins multiple files together for the print) and prints/displays the contents of files in the terminal 
-- note that only works on text files ... can convert a pdf to text with command pdftotext and then view that 

--

less
#==> displays the contents of a file, one page at a time [use less rather than cat for long files as will be easier to view/scroll thru]
- can hit space bar to go through pages at a time [or any commands that use in manuals, as man uses less]
  - space || f to go to the next page of the file
  - b to go back to the previous page 
  - Enter or Down arrow to scroll by one line 
  - to search, type forward slash / followed by a pattern
  - quit the less window within terminal by hitting q 

--

tac 
#==> does same things as cat but prints the files in reverse, vertically (ie last line will be printed first, etc)

-- 
rev 
#==> prints the contents of the file, reversing the order, horizontally (ie reverses letters in all words on each line)

## note that cat, less, tac and rev dont modify the files themselves, just print them in various ways to our terminal console 

-- 

head 
#==> prints the first 10 lines of a file to our terminal 
is 10 by default, can write -n 12, for example, to print first 12 lines
|| can just write > head -12 file (don't need the -n before the number)

tail 
#==> prints the last 10 lines of a file to our terminal 
same as head, 10 is default.. and can use the -n option to change the number of lines to print 
option -f on tail ... with the follow option, the tail command will stay open and add any appends to the file as those edits are made... ex. this is useful to monitor logs 

-- 
wc 
#==> the word count command can tell us the number of words, lines, or bytes in files 
by default, prints out 3 numbers... the lines, words, and bytes in a file 

> wc -l #==> will only print the number of lines
> wc -w #==> will only print the number of words 
> wc -m #==> will only print the number of characters  
> wc -c #==> will only print the number of bytes 

--
sort 
#==> outputs the sorted contents of a file. by default, will sort the lines of a file alphabetically 
- the option -r will sort in reverse order
- option -n will sort numerically 
- option -u will ignore duplicate values and only sort unique values
- if file has columns, can use option -k columnnumber ex. > sort -k 2 file [otherwise will always sort by values in the first column, column 1]


------

tr
#==> will take text from standard input and change/translate text in a specified way 
[tr is one of several commands commonly used to transform text, other common ones are sed, awk, and mawk]

ex. 
cat msg [[ie a file named msg]] #==> she sells seashells by the seashore
cat msg | tr s S #=> She SellS SeaShellS by the SeaShore 
cat msg | tr a-z A-Z #==> SHE SELLS SEASHELLS BY THE SEASHORE 
cat msg | tr -d s #==> he ell eahell by the eahore 

--

du 
#==> disc usage 
du -ha FOLDER #==> will show the file sizes of all files in a folder 

-- 

tee 
#=> the tee program reads standard input and copies it to both standard output and to a file. this allows us to capture info part of the way thru a pipeline, w/o interrupting the flow 

ex. > command1 | tee file.txt | command2 
^^ command1 output will go to both file.txt and to command2 

-- 

locate
#==> the locate command performs a search of pathnames across our machine that match a given substring and then prints out any matching names 
- locate uses a built-in database file where it stores list of files on the machine, rather than having to search the whole machine each time run this command

- can use with wildcards ex. location less???

options.. 
locate -i (ignores casing)
locate -l (limit to a number of matches)
locate -e (only shows files that exist.. ex. if have removed files but database hasnt updated yet)

--

find 
#==> more powerful way to find files than the locate command as does not use a database, but b/c of this is slower to return results.
by default, find will list every single file and directory nested in our current working directory [on linux, on mac, need to specify a specific path for find command to work!, ex. for current directory just write > find . etc...  as . signifies current directory]
can also provide a specific folder ex. find directory/
- the big difference between find and ls is that find outputs all nested folders and files so that can see everything that is inside a parent directory in one result 

find -type f (limits search to files)
find -type d (limits search to folders/directories)

find -name "..." (put some sort of pattern between the quotes)
find -iname (works same as -name but is case insensitive)

ex. find ~/programming2022 -type f -name "*.txt" #==> will list all files ending in .txt that exist in the folder programming2022 

find -size +1G (find files larger than 1 gigabyte)
find -size -1G (find files smaller than 1 gigabyte)

can use the -and, -or, and -not logical operators to create more complex queries
ex. 
find /path -type -f -not -name "*.html" #==> find all files that do not end in .html 
ex2.
find ~ -cmin -60 -not -name "*.log" #==> find all files/folders changed within the last 60 minutes and (and is implied) that dont end in .log
- can write -not as ! instead 

find -exec command {} ; 
ex. find ~/programming2022 -type f -empty -exec ls -l '{}' ';'

find -ok command {} ; #==> works same as -exec but prompts before executing for each file (ex. use if mass deleting files with rm)

-- 

xargs 
#==> a command that is most commonly used with the find command instead of -exec. when we provide a command via -exec, that command is executed separately for every single element. we can instead use a special command called xargs to build up the input into a bundle that will be provided as an argument list to the next command (often -exec or xarg are used for commands that dont accept standard input, ex. ls ) 

ex. 
find . -name "*/txt" -exec ls '{}' ';' 
find . -name "*.txt" | xargs ls 
^ both options will output the same items visually, although are working differently 

-- 

grep 
#==> the grep command searches for patterns in each file's contents. grep will print each line that matches a pattern we provide. 
ex. grep "chicken" animals.txt . #=> will print each line from the animals.txt file that contains the pattern "chicken" // note that the . or whatever directory that are trying to search has to be the last item listed for the grep command 

-grep by default is case sensitive 

grep -i #==> case insensitive option 
grep -w #==> ie. word search... use the -w option to ensure that grep only matches words, rather than fragments located inside of other words. 

// grep recursive search 

use the -r option to perform a recursive search which will include all files under a directory, subfolders and their files, etc 

// other common options, examples

-c (count)
grep "myself" SongOfMyself.txt -ic 
#==> 47 #==> means that the word "myself" is written 47 times in that text file 

-A# (will return a match + # of lines after)
-B# (will return a match + # of lines before)
-C# (will return a match + # of lines before and after)
ex. grep "wagon" SongOfMyself.txt -C1 
#==> 
The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,
The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon,
The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,
--
--
The machinist rolls up his sleeves, the policeman travels his beat, the gate-keeper marks who pass,
The young fellow drives the express-wagon, (I love him, though I do not know him;)
The half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race,
--
--
My face rubs to the hunter’s face when he lies down alone in his blanket,
The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,
The young mother and old mother comprehend me,

-n (line number)
ex. grep "wagon" SongOfMyself.txt -n 
#==> 
226:The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon,
376:The young fellow drives the express-wagon, (I love him, though I do not know him;)
1641:The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,

-m# (will limit the number of results we get, ex m1 will only return the first instance of the grep search)

// grep with regular expressions 

ex. 
grep 'p......' SongOfMyself.txt -w #==> find all words that start with p and have 6 characters after in SongOfMyself.txt file 

grep "^I" SongOfMyself.txt -w #==> find all lines that start with the letter I 

grep ")$" SongOfMyself #==> find all lines that end with ) 

grep "2[1-6]" SongOfMyself.txt -A8 #==> print the first 8 lines of sections 21-26 

// egrep 
ie. extended regular expression syntax option for grep 

ex. 

egrep "birds?" -w SongOfMyself.txt #==> ? regex implies that the s is optional so will find all lines that contain either bird or birds 

egrep "[aeiou]{2}" SongOfMyself.txt #==> searching for lines that have words with 2 vowels next to each other 

// piping to grep 
- a common use case is to use grep to filter down a large chunk of data. 

ex. man command | grep "search" 
--> man ls | grep "time"
#==>
-c      Use time when file status was last changed for sorting (-t) or
             complete time information for the file, including month, day,
     -t      Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sort-
     -u      Use time of last access, instead of last modification of the file
     -U      Use time of file creation, instead of last modification for sort-
     mines the file time used.
     If the modification time of the file is more than 6 months in the past or
     TZ              The timezone to use when displaying dates.  See


--

chmod
#==> the change mode command can change the permissions of a file or directory 
- need to tell chmod...
  who are we changing permissions for
  what change are we making? ie adding/removing
  which permissions are we setting 

2 ways to use chmod (ie 2 syntaxes that can use):
  1. symbolic notation 
    who
      u - user (ie file owner)
      g - group 
      o - others 
      a - all of the above 
    what 
      - (minus sign) removes the permission
      + grants the permission 
      = set a permission as the only permission and remove others 
    which 
      r - read permission 
      w - write permission 
      x - execute permission 

    ex. 
    chmod g+w file.txt #==> add write permissions for group members 
    chmod a=r file.txt #==> sets permissions to read ONLY for all (ie -r--r--r--)

  2. octal notation (ie base 8 numbers)
    - each digit in an octal represents 3 binary digits 
    Octal     Binary    File Mode 
    0         000       ---         off-off-off
    1         001       --x         off-off-on 
    2         010       -w-         off-on-off 
    3         011       -wx         etc... 
    4         100       r--
    5         101       r-x 
    6         110       rw- 
    7         111       rwx 

    ex. 
    chmod 755 file.txt 
    #==> owner at octal 7, group at octal 5, world at octal 5 
    #==> owner 111, group 101, world 101 
    #==> -rwxr-xr-x 

--
su
#==> substitute user 

> su - newuser 
(note that need the dash(-) in the command so that are in the correct user environment... dash(-) is a shortcut for --login )
then, will be prompted to enter the newuser password 
if want to log out, just type "exit" and will go back to main user account 

-- 
chown 
#==> change ownership command is used to the change the owner and/or group owner of a spefific file or directory 

- have to use sudo in order to use chown 

owner.. > sudo chown ownername file 
group owner.. > sudo chown :groupname file

-- 
addgroup 
#==> create a new group ; need sudo 

--
adduser 
#==> add users to a group ; need sudo 

-- 
curl 
#==> requests a URL from the web and outputs the response 
ex. 
curl "wttr.in" 
--> will show us the 3 day weather for current location 

used ~/bin to create a 'weather' command which pulls this URL 

--
code 
#==> will open a file/directory in VS code
(note that i set my default editor to nano in ~/.zprofile (was by default vi).. i think that i could set it to open VS code instead if wanted)
