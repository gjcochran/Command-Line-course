# wildcard characters (aka globbing patterns)

- can use special wildcard characters to build paterns that can match multiple filenames at once
// the * Wildcard 
- the asterick (*) character represents zero or more characters in a filename
  ex....
  ls *.html will match any files that end with .html
  cat blue* will match any files that start with "blue"
  echo *at* will list all files that contain at ex. data.txt would be listed if its in the directory 

// the ? Wildcard  
- the question mark (?) character represents any single character

ex...
  ls app.?? with match any files named app that end with any two characters ex. app.js ; app.py 

  ls pic?.png will match, for example... pic1.png, pic2.png, pica.png 

// Range Wildcards 
- inside of square brackets, [], we can specify a range of characters to match 

ex....
  ls pic[123].png #==> print all files that are pic1.png, pic2.png, or pic3.png 
  ls file[0-9]
  ls [A-F]*

- can negate a range with the caret character (^)

ex.. 
  echo [^A-Z]* #==> list all files that do not start with an uppercase letter
