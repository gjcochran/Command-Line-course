- options modify the commands behavior

most commands support a host of options that we can choose to use when executing the command. they will modify the behavior of the command in predefined ways. options are prefixed by a dash, ex. -h

can combine multiple options 

ex. 
> ncal -3 -j
OR 
> ncal -3j
//#==> both of those will print a new version of calendar that shows 3 months and in a julian calendar 

some commands support long form options, note that most commands don't 

ex. 
> date -u 
OR 
> date --universal 
//#==> both of these will print the date in UTC time, rather than current timezone 

- arguments are the things that the command acts upon or uses

arguments aka parameters aka operands

can pass in file names as arguments

ex. > sort file.txt //==> will print out each line of the file.txt file in alphabetical order
