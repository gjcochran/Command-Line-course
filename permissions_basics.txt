- unix and unix-like systems are multiuser operating systems.
- every file/directory has a file owner and a group owner
  - groups allow us to group together various users and setting permissions settings for said group

ls -l
first column returns a 10 character return of the file attributes...
ex.
-rw-rw-r--
these characters tell us the type of the file, the read, write, and execute permission's for the file's owner, the file's group owner, and everyone else

-rw-rw-r--
0123456789

  0 = file type

    - regular file
    d directory
    c character special file
    l symbolic link
    b block special files (refer to a device)

  123 = file owner permissions
  456 = group owner permissions
  789 = everyone else's permissions

for 123, 456, & 789 ...
rwx = can read, write, and execute
rw- = can read and write, but cannot execute
r-x = can read and execute, but cannot write
r-- = can read but cannot write or execute

r ... file can be read || directory's conents can be listed
w ... file can be modified/edited (ie inside of an existing file) || directory's contents can be modified (ie create new files, rename files/folders) but only if the executable attribute is also set 
x ... file can be treated as a program to be executed || allows a directory to be entered or "cd"ed into
